# Info
Note: as GitHub deletes the files with .obj extension, the game does not load well when loaded with Unity.\ To run the game unzip the Build.zip found in the Build folder, and execute "lara.exe". 

The description in Spanish of the game and its development can be found in the file "Memoria.pdf".
